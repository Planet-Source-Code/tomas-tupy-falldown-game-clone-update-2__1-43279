### Description

A clone of the graphing calculator game Falldown, but much better, with special features. This is the best clone of the game on on PSC. Check it out. Includes a high score and different speeds. Uses one main loop, no timers. It might be slow if you have a lot of applications open. It took me a while, so DON'T FORGET TO VOTE AND COMMENT :)
 
### More Info
 
if the game is slow, try closing other running applications. (VB isn't made for games) :)
